A **Stack** is a simple way to organize data, and it works exactly like objects in the real world.\n\n---\n\n### What is a Stack?\nIn programming, a stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a specific order. Imagine a physical stack of cafeteria trays or a pile of books. You can only add a new tray to the **top**, and if you want to take one away, you have to take it from the **top** as well.\n\n### The Golden Rule: LIFO\nThe stack follows one main rule called **LIFO**, which stands for:\n**Last In, First Out.**\n\nThis means the last item you put into the stack is the very first one that gets taken out. If you put a red book on a pile, then a blue book, you have to pick up the blue one before you can reach the red one.\n\n---\n\n### Basic Operations\nThere are three main things you can do with a stack:\n\n1.  **Push:** Adding an item to the top of the stack.\n2.  **Pop:** Removing the item from the top of the stack.\n3.  **Peek (or Top):** Looking at the top item without actually removing it.\n\n---\n\n### Real-World Examples\n\n#### 1. The \"Undo\" Button\nHave you ever been typing an essay and accidentally deleted a paragraph? You hit `Ctrl + Z` (Undo), and it reappears. \n*   **How it works:** Every action you take (typing a word, changing a font) is \"Pushed\" onto a stack. When you hit Undo, the computer \"Pops\" the last action you did off the stack and reverses it.\n\n#### 2. Web Browser History\nThink about the \"Back\" button on your internet browser.\n*   **How it works:** As you click from Page A to Page B to Page C, the browser \"Pushes\" those addresses onto a stack. When you click \"Back,\" it \"Pops\" Page C to show you Page B.\n\n---\n\n### A Simple Visual Example\nImagine we have an empty stack and we want to store some numbers.\n\n1.  **Push(10):** Stack is now `[10]`\n2.  **Push(20):** Stack is now `[10, 20]` (20 is on top)\n3.  **Push(30):** Stack is now `[10, 20, 30]` (30 is on top)\n4.  **Pop():** The computer removes 30. Stack is back to `[10, 20]`\n\n---\n\n### Summary for Study\n*   **Structure:** Linear (like a line or a pile).\n*   **Access:** Only at the **Top**.\n*   **Principle:** LIFO (Last In, First Out).\n*   **Main Actions:** Push (Add) and Pop (Remove).",

Introduction to Stacks\nA **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)**. This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.\n\nAt the University/Professional level, we view a Stack as an **Abstract Data Type (ADT)**. It is a restricted version of a list where insertion and deletion are allowed only at one end, called the **Top**.\n\n### Core Operations\n*   **Push:** Adds an item to the stack. If the stack is full, it results in a *Stack Overflow*.\n*   **Pop:** Removes an item from the stack. If the stack is empty, it results in a *Stack Underflow*.\n*   **Peek (or Top):** Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.\n*   **isEmpty:** Returns true if the stack is empty.\n*   **isFull:** Returns true if the stack is full (relevant for fixed-size array implementations).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Programming Implementation (Python)\n\nIn a professional context, stacks are often implemented using dynamic arrays (lists) or linked lists. Below is a class-based implementation using a list.\n\n```python\nclass Stack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stack = []\n\n    def is_empty(self):\n        return len(self.stack) == 0\n\n    def push(self, item):\n        self.stack.append(item)\n        print(f\"Pushed: {item}\")\n\n    def pop(self):\n        if self.is_empty():\n            return \"Stack Underflow\"\n        return self.stack.pop()\n\n    def peek(self):\n        if self.is_empty():\n            return \"Stack is empty\"\n        return self.stack[-1]\n\n    def size(self):\n        return len(self.stack)\n\n# Logic Execution\ns = Stack()\ns.push(10)\ns.push(20)\ns.push(30)\nprint(f\"Top element: {s.peek()}\") # Output: 30\nprint(f\"Popped element: {s.pop()}\") # Output: 30\nprint(f\"New Top: {s.peek()}\") # Output: 20\n```\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n*   **Time Complexity:**\n    *   Push: $O(1)$\n    *   Pop: $O(1)$\n    *   Peek: $O(1)$\n    *   Search: $O(n)$\n*   **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements stored.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Real-World Applications\n1.  **Function Call Stack:** Compilers use stacks to manage function calls and local variables. When a function is called, an \"activation record\" is pushed onto the stack.\n2.  **Expression Parsing:** Used in converting Infix expressions to Postfix/Prefix and evaluating them.\n3.  **Undo/Redo Operations:** Applications like Photoshop or Word Processors store your history in a stack.\n4.  **Backtracking:** Used in algorithms for maze solving or finding paths in graphs (DFS).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Points Summary\n*   **LIFO Principle:** The core logic of stack behavior.\n*   **Restricted Access:** You can only access the \"Top\" element.\n*   **Efficiency:** Stacks are highly efficient for insertion and deletion ($O(1)$).\n*   **Implementation:** Can be implemented via Arrays (fixed size) or Linked Lists (dynamic size).\n*   **Overflow/Underflow:** Essential edge cases to handle in production code.\n\n---\n\n## 5.
